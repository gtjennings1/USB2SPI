@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\projects_2018\usb2spi\trunk\usb2spi_xo2_bob_3_9_18\soucre\usb_phy\usb_tx_phy.vhd":183:4:183:5|Found inferred clock pll_60MHz|CLKOP_inferred_clock which controls 472 sequential elements including usb_2_spi_unit.usb_fs_slave_1.usb_phy_1.i_tx_phy.bit_cnt[2:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
